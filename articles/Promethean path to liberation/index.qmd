# **Introduction**

Western technological societies face an increasing crisis of mental suffering, characterized by alienation, anxiety, and depression. While scholars such as Hartmut Rosa (2019) identify acceleration as a key factor in this crisis, a deeper examination reveals that the root cause lies in Misplaced Abstractness—the cognitive error of mistaking abstract conceptualizations for fundamental ontological truths. This essay explores how the Prometheus archetype serves as a symbol of regaining agency, creativity, and free will in the face of this crisis. By transcending deterministic abstractions and reconnecting with the dynamic nature of existence, individuals can liberate themselves from the mental suffering imposed by modern technocratic society.

## **Misplaced Abstractness as the Root of Mental Suffering**

The prevailing metaphysical frameworks of materialism, dualism, and idealism have led to a distorted perception of reality, trapping individuals in an existential void. Materialism (e.g., Dennett, 1991) reduces human consciousness to mere neural processes, stripping away meaning. Dualism (Descartes, 1641/1996) fragments the self into irreconcilable mind-body substances. Idealism (Kant, 1781/1998) risks detaching individuals from the external world entirely. These positions fall into what can be termed the Fallacy of Misplaced Abstractness, where theoretical constructs are mistaken for ontological realities.

This error severs individuals from the relational and vibrational nature of reality, leading to a loss of authentic agency and spiritual disconnection. The resulting existential anxiety and depression are not merely caused by the pace of life but by a deeper cognitive dissonance between human perception and the fundamental nature of existence.

## **Rene Guénon and the Crisis of Modernity**

Rene Guénon (1946/2004), in The Crisis of the Modern World, provides a foundational critique of Western modernity that aligns with the issue of Misplaced Abstractness. He argues that the modern world has undergone a spiritual degeneration, replacing sacred knowledge and metaphysical wisdom with rationalism, scientism, and materialism. This shift has led to the fragmentation of human consciousness, disconnecting individuals from traditional sources of meaning and higher truths.

Guénon's critique highlights how Western societies, in their pursuit of technological progress and material domination, have fallen into a pathological abstraction of reality, reducing existence to mechanistic and utilitarian principles. This condition exacerbates alienation and suffering, as human beings are deprived of their innate connection to the transcendent.

## **The Promethean Archetype: Reclaiming Agency, Creativity, and Free Will**

Prometheus, the Titan who defied the gods by bringing fire to humanity, serves as a powerful symbol of resistance against imposed limitations. His story embodies the human struggle for freedom, knowledge, and creative transformation—all of which are essential in breaking free from the constraints of Misplaced Abstractness.

### **1. Prometheus and the Rebirth of Free Will**

Prometheus' defiance against divine authority mirrors the need to reject deterministic abstractions that rob individuals of agency. Just as he stole fire to illuminate the darkness, individuals must reclaim their innate freedom by transcending the restrictive metaphysical assumptions of materialism, dualism, and idealism. Free will, rather than being an illusion (Dennett, 2003), is an active force of creative engagement with reality.

Jason Reza Jorjani (2016, 2019) has extensively analyzed the Prometheus archetype as a symbol of human spiritual and intellectual evolution. In Prometheus and Atlas, he argues that Prometheus represents the force of creative rebellion and the rejection of imposed dogmas, particularly within scientific and philosophical paradigms. In Prometheism, he extends this idea by advocating for a radical re-enchantment of reality, where human beings actively shape their destiny rather than passively accepting deterministic models (Jorjani, 2019).

### **2. Creativity as a Path to Healing**

Prometheus represents not only rebellion but also the transformative power of creation. Fire symbolizes knowledge, artistic expression, and the ability to forge new paths. In modern society, reclaiming creativity—whether through art, philosophy, or scientific inquiry—serves as an antidote to existential alienation. Creativity allows individuals to engage dynamically with existence, rather than passively conforming to rigid conceptual structures.

Jorjani (2023) further elaborates on this idea in his discussions on the sociological impact of the Prometheus archetype. In his lecture (Jorjani, 2023), he emphasizes that Promethean creativity is essential for overcoming technocratic alienation, which reduces individuals to mere components of an automated system, stripping them of their imaginative and spiritual potential.

### **3. Reconnecting Spirit and Soul with Reality**

Prometheus challenges hierarchical structures that impose false ontologies. His myth suggests that true resonance with reality is not found in adaptation to societal speed but in an active re-engagement with the vibrational nature of being. This involves embracing the paradoxes of existence—both structure and fluidity, both agency and interconnectedness—rather than succumbing to static abstractions.

## **Hartmut Rosa’s Resonance Theory as an Example**

Hartmut Rosa’s Resonance Theory (2019) provides a valuable but incomplete diagnosis of modern alienation. He argues that individuals suffer due to an inability to keep pace with acceleration in technological, economic, and social domains. While acceleration is a significant factor, Rosa’s framework fails to address the deeper ontological error underlying alienation.

Misplaced Abstractness, rather than acceleration alone, is the true source of mental suffering. Acceleration is merely an external manifestation of a deeper cognitive and spiritual disconnection. Rosa’s emphasis on slowing down and fostering resonance with the world is valuable, yet it does not challenge the metaphysical assumptions that create alienation in the first place.

A Promethean approach would go beyond resonance to advocate for an active reclaiming of agency. Rather than simply adapting to societal conditions, individuals must transform their ontological perspective—moving beyond static abstractions and engaging with reality as an ever-evolving, participatory process.
