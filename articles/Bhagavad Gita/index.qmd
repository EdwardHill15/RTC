# **Introduction**

In my Resonance Theory of Consciousness (RTC), I argue that the metaphysical framework of the Bhagavad Gita, which denies free will and self-determination in favor of submission to divine authority, is rooted in a fundamental epistemological error. This error, which I term the "Fallacy of Misplaced Abstractness," stands in direct contrast to Alfred North Whitehead’s "Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness." While Whitehead’s fallacy refers to the mistaken treatment of abstract concepts as concrete realities, my formulation of "Misplaced Abstractness" describes the improper hierarchical placement of abstract concepts within a structural analogy, leading to flawed metaphysical conclusions.

## **The Structural Error in the Bhagavad Gita’s Metaphysics**

To illustrate this fallacy, consider the following mean analogy:

A : B :: B : C

Here, the mean term (B) represents the subjective human mind, which functions as the mediator between the observed reality (C) and the ultimate understanding of the real nature of reality (A). The integrity of this structure depends on the correct placement of the mean term, ensuring that the human mind can fulfill its mediating role. However, the metaphysical framework presented in the Bhagavad Gita disrupts this hierarchical arrangement by elevating the subjective human mind (B) to the position of the first, principal term (A), thus eliminating its mediating function. This misplacement results in a flattened metaphysical structure where human consciousness is stripped of its agency and subordinated entirely to an external cosmic order dictated by Brahman.

## **Consequences of Misplacing the Mean Term**
By placing Brahman at the highest ontological level and rendering the human mind passive, the Bhagavad Gita negates the possibility of individual self-determination. In this framework, human beings are not co-creators of reality but mere recipients of divine will. The loss of the mediating role of consciousness means that subjective experience becomes irrelevant in shaping reality. Instead, all structuring, creation, and vision of reality are attributed exclusively to Brahman, reducing human agency to mere acceptance of predetermined fate.

This metaphysical stance contradicts the Promethean ideal of self-determination and creative agency, as articulated in my broader philosophical work. A proper understanding of consciousness must recognize the necessity of mediation—where the mind serves as a bridge between external reality and ultimate comprehension—rather than positioning it as an inert receptacle of cosmic determinism.
Reasserting the hierarchical structure of consciousness
To overcome the fallacy inherent in the Bhagavad Gita’s metaphysics, we must restore the correct placement of the mean term in the analogy. Recognizing the mind’s rightful position as an active mediator reinstates the hierarchical structure necessary for genuine knowledge and self-determined action. In this revised framework, consciousness is neither a passive recipient nor an omnipotent creator but an essential intermediary that both interprets and shapes reality.

By acknowledging this structural necessity, we move beyond the deterministic worldview of the Bhagavad Gita and towards a model of consciousness that affirms free will, creativity, and self-determination. This shift is crucial for a metaphysics that genuinely supports human autonomy and the evolution of knowledge.

# **Conclusion**
The Bhagavad Gita’s metaphysical framework suffers from the Fallacy of Misplaced Abstractness by misplacing the subjective human mind at the top of the ontological hierarchy rather than recognizing its mediating role. This misplacement leads to a deterministic worldview in which human agency is negated, and reality is solely dictated by an external divine authority. The core of this fallacy lies in the deification of the subjective human mind to the status of an almighty god, Brahman. As a consequence, human beings are reduced to willingless and autonomousless creatures, devoid of any real capacity to shape their own destiny. By restoring the correct hierarchical structure in our understanding of consciousness, we reclaim the possibility of free will, self-determination, and an active role in shaping reality. The proper metaphysical model must, therefore, recognize consciousness as a dynamic mediator rather than a passive recipient of divine decree.
