abstract = {Discusses how competition between afferent data and learned feedback expectancies can stabilize a developing code by buffering committed populations of detectors against continual erosion by new environmental demands. The gating phenomena that result lead to dynamically maintained critical periods and to attentional phenomena such as overshadowing in the adult. The functional unit of cognitive coding is suggested to be an adaptive resonance, or amplification and prolongation of neural activity, that occurs when afferent data and efferent expectancies reach consensus through a matching process. The resonant state embodies the perceptual event, and its amplified and sustained activities are capable of driving slow changes of long-term memory. These mechanisms help to explain and predict (a) positive and negative aftereffects, the McCollough effect, spatial frequency adaptation, monocular rivalry, binocular rivalry and hysteresis, pattern completion, and Gestalt switching; (b) analgesia, partial reinforcement acquisition effect, conditioned reinforcers, underaroused vs overaroused depression; (c) the contingent negative variation, P300, and pontogeniculo-occipital waves; and (d) olfactory coding, corticogeniculate feedback, matching of proprioceptive and terminal motor maps, and cerebral dominance.

@article{Chen2025,
abstract = {Analyses of functional connectivity (FC) in resting-state brain networks (RSNs) have generated many insights into cognition. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of FC and RSNs are still not well-understood. It remains debated whether resting-state activity is best characterized as reflecting noise-driven fluctuations around a single stable state, or instead, as a nonlinear dynamical system with nontrivial attractors embedded in the RSNs. Here, we provide evidence for the latter, by constructing whole-brain dynamical systems models from individual resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) recordings, using the Mesoscale Individualized NeuroDynamic (MINDy) framework. The MINDy models consist of hundreds of neural masses representing brain parcels, connected by fully trainable, individualized weights. We found that our models manifested a diverse taxonomy of nontrivial attractor landscapes including multiple equilibria and limit cycles. However, when projected into anatomical space, these attractors mapped onto a limited set of canonical RSNs, including the default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal control network (FPN), which were reliable at the individual level. Further, by creating convex combinations of models, bifurcations were induced that recapitulated the full spectrum of dynamics found via fitting. These findings suggest that the resting brain traverses a diverse set of dynamics, which generate several distinct but anatomically overlapping attractor landscapes. Treating rfMRI as a unimodal stationary process (i.e., conventional FC) may miss critical attractor properties and structure within the resting brain. Instead, these may be better captured through neural dynamical modeling and analytic approaches. The results provide new insights into the generative mechanisms and intrinsic spatiotemporal organization of brain networks.},

@article{Stam2005,
abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper - as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {There are various electromagnetic (EM) field theories of consciousness. They postulate an epineural EM field which, due to its binding properties, unifies the different neuronal information differences originating from various sensory and cognitive processes. Only through a real physical integration in space within this field could phenomenal consciousness arise. This would solve the binding problem mentioned in the philosophy of mind. On closer inspection, the electromagnetic interaction not only provides an explanation for the integrative property of the EM field, but also for the necessary differentiating contrasts of information. This article will take a closer look at the physical properties of a postulated EM field. It will also show how the problem of qualia in connection with emergentism could be solved by a new variant of EM field theory. If it can be clearly demonstrated that the postulated epineural EM field plays a decisive role in the origin of consciousness in addition to neuronal “wired” information processing, this also leaves less room for metaphysical assumptions that attempt to solve the binding problem. In experiments to prove the postulated epineural EM field by means of external electromagnetic manipulations, it can never be ruled out that these also have a direct effect on the “wired” neuronal signal processing. Therefore, on the way to proving the EM field theory of consciousness, an experimental method is needed that must ensure that external manipulations only affect the extensions of the EM field without directly influencing the neuronal network. A method will be discussed here that works with the shielding of EM fields instead of external electromagnetic stimuli.},

abstract = {Two previously identified difficulties with the electromagnetic field theory of consciousness are discussed. The first difficulty is that, although spitiotemporal electromagnetic patterns co-varying with conscious experiences have been identified in rabbits and cats, no analogous patterns have yet been found in humans. Evidence is cited that this is very likely because the relevant patterns are inaccessible from the scalp. Recording from the surface of the human brain will be necessary. Such electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings are feasible in the context of localizing epileptogenic foci, but logistical difficulties have so far prevented their being done with a view to identifying spatial patterns covarying with conscious sensations. The second difficulty is that, although electromagnetic fields certainly can cause neural firing, the same mathematical calculations that show the need for ECoG reveal that the spatial patterns proposed as being conscious become unidentifiable such a short distance away from their source that they are ill suited to causing behavior by activating neurons in other areas of the brain. This difficulty is rendered unimportant by an accumulation of empirical evidence that consciousness is actually not causal for behavior. A number of philosophical objections to this evidence are dissected. The conclusion is arrived at that the electromagnetic field theory of consciousness is still very much alive and kicking.},
