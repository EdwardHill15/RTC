# Introduction to RTC Atlas

The Resonance Theory of Consciousness (RTC) Atlas presents computational models and visualizations for key concepts in resonance-based consciousness ontology. This document integrates **8 core R programs** that form the analytical backbone of RTC research.

These programs demonstrate psychophysical time quanta, resonance patterns, temporal binding, multi-scale consciousness metrics, and the **fundamental bimodal mind structure (Me ⊕ Mp)**.

## Program 1: Resonance Wave Simulation

Theoretical Foundation: Neural resonance forms the cornerstone of RTC ontology, where consciousness emerges from synchronized oscillatory dynamics across neural populations. This program models a minimalist S-I (Synchronous-Inhibitory) oscillator system using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), capturing the emergence of 40Hz gamma oscillations - the canonical frequency of conscious binding.

Computational Methodology: The deSolve::ode() solver integrates a two-state system where:

-   S(t) = Synchronous population amplitude, driven by external resonance forcing sin(2πk_rest)

-   I(t) = Inhibitory population amplitude, providing feedback stabilization

-   Parameters: k_res = 1/40 (40Hz), θ = 0.8 (coupling strength)

The system exhibits limit cycle behavior, transitioning from initial transients to stable resonant oscillation, demonstrating how micro-scale synchrony seeds macro-scale consciousness.

RTC Significance: This simulation validates RTC's core hypothesis that consciousness requires persistent resonant structure rather than static connectivity. The observed phase-locking mirrors empirical EEG gamma-band findings during conscious perception.

  # Analytic solution for driven damped oscillator

           label = "40Hz Conscious\nBinding Window", 
           size = 4.5, fontface = "bold", color = "gold")

```

## Program 2: Temporal Binding Window

Theoretical Foundation: RTC posits that conscious integration occurs within discrete temporal binding windows (\~50-100ms) mediated by cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Theta (4-8Hz) rhythms gate gamma (30-100Hz) bursts, creating perceptual "frames" that bind multisensory input into unified experience.

**Computational Methodology: The model generates amplitude-modulated (AM) coupling:**

```         
                          γ(t) = sin(Φγ(t)) × (1 + 0.5 × sin(Φθ(t)))
      
```

where Φγ(t) accumulates phase based on instantaneous frequency fγ(t) = 40 + 8sin(Φθ(t)). Binding strength = \|γ(t) × sin(Φθ(t))\| quantifies successful cross-scale integration.

RTC Significance: Demonstrates how RTC's psychophysical time quantum emerges from continuous neural dynamics. The binding strength envelope traces the temporal window where discrete conscious moments crystallize, bridging neural continuity with perceptual discreteness.

```{r}
#| label: prog2-temporal-binding
#| fig-cap: "Theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling for temporal binding."

n <- 1000
theta_phase <- seq(0, 4*pi, length.out = n)
gamma_freq <- 40 + 8 * sin(theta_phase)
gamma_phase <- cumsum(2*pi * gamma_freq / 400)
signal <- sin(gamma_phase) * (1 + 0.5 * sin(theta_phase))

time_axis <- seq(0, 2.5, length.out = n)

binding_df <- tibble::tibble(
  time = time_axis,
  theta = sin(theta_phase),
  gamma = signal,
  binding_strength = abs(signal * sin(theta_phase))
) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(c(theta, gamma, binding_strength), 
               names_to = "component", values_to = "value")

ggplot(binding_df, aes(x = time, y = value, color = component)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.8, size = 1) +
  labs(title = "RTC Program 2: Temporal Binding Window",
       subtitle = "Cross-frequency coupling dynamics",
       x = "Time (s)", y = "Neural Signal") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("theta" = "#FF7F00", 
                               "gamma" = "#2E8B57", 
                               "binding_strength" = "#8A2BE2"))

```

## Program 3: Consciousness Coordinate System

Theoretical Foundation: RTC formalizes consciousness as a 3D manifold in {Frequency, Phase, Amplitude} coordinate space. Conscious states occupy stable manifolds where small perturbations preserve resonant structure, while unconscious states occupy transient trajectories.

Computational Methodology: The surface A(f,φ) = sin(φ) × f/100 + 0.1 maps:

-   x-axis: Frequency (1-100Hz, neural oscillatory range)

-   y-axis: Phase (0-2π radians)

-   z-axis: Normalized amplitude (resonance strength)

RTC Significance: Provides geometric ontology for consciousness states. High-amplitude ridges correspond to phi-like integrated information, while phase valleys represent decoherence (anesthesia, coma). Enables quantification of conscious "distance" between brain states.

```{r}
#| label: prog3-coord-map
#| fig-cap: "3D consciousness coordinate system (frequency × phase × amplitude)."

library(plotly)

freq <- seq(1, 100, length.out = 30)
phase <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 30)
amp <- outer(freq, phase, function(f, p) sin(p) * f/100 + 0.1)

p <- plot_ly(z = ~amp, x = ~freq, y = ~phase,
             type = "surface",
             colorscale = "Viridis") %>%
  layout(title = "RTC Program 3: Consciousness Coordinate Map",
         scene = list(
           xaxis = list(title = "Frequency (Hz)"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Phase (rad)"),
           zaxis = list(title = "Normalized Amplitude")
         ))

p
```

## Program 4: Multi-Scale Resonance Cascade

Theoretical Foundation: Consciousness manifests across four spatiotemporal scales: cellular (ms), local circuits (10ms), regional networks (100ms), global workspace (1s). RTC predicts coherence amplification with increasing scale due to recursive resonance.

Computational Methodology:

```         
                        Power(scale) = Coherence(scale) × log(1/Timescale)
    
```

where coherence increases monotonically: Cellular(0.2) → Local(0.45) → Regional(0.7) → Global(0.95). Logarithmic timescale compression reflects psychophysical time dilation.

RTC Significance: Explains scale-invariant signature of consciousness - why global 40Hz gamma predicts awareness despite originating in cellular gap junction resonance. Validates RTC's hierarchical ontology against empirical multi-scale EEG/sLORETA findings.

```{r}
#| label: prog4-multi-scale
#| fig-cap: "Resonance propagation across neural scales."

scales <- c("Cellular", "Local", "Regional", "Global")
timescale <- c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0)
coherence <- c(0.2, 0.45, 0.7, 0.95)

cascade_df <- tibble(
  scale = factor(scales, levels = scales),
  timescale = timescale,
  coherence = coherence,
  resonance_power = coherence * log(1/timescale)
)

ggplot(cascade_df, aes(x = timescale, y = resonance_power, fill = scale)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_log10() +  # FIXED: Removed labels = scales
  labs(title = "RTC Program 4: Multi-Scale Resonance Cascade",
       subtitle = "Scale-dependent coherence amplification",
       x = "Timescale (s)", y = "Resonance Power") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()

```

## Program 5: Psychophysical Time Quantum

Theoretical Foundation: RTC's fundamental innovation - continuous neural time t maps onto discrete perceptual quanta τ ≈ 50ms. Consciousness doesn't "flow" continuously but instantiates as stroboscopic frames sampling the resonance field.

Computational Methodology:

-   Generate continuous neural signal: α(12Hz) + γ(40Hz) with exponential decay

-   Segment into 50ms bins: τᵢ = mean(t ∈ \[iτ, (i+1)τ))

-   Interpolate step function: τ(t) = approx(τᵢ, t)

RTC Significance: Solves hard problem of temporal phenomenology - why subjective time feels discrete despite continuous physics. The step function envelope traces conscious "moments," matching human temporal resolution limits and 20Hz perceptual flicker fusion.

```{r}
#| label: prog5-time-quantum
#| fig-cap: "Continuous → discrete perceptual time transformation."

t_cont <- seq(0, 3, by = 0.001)
neural_signal <- sin(2*pi*12*t_cont) * exp(-0.1*t_cont) + 
                 0.3 * sin(2*pi*40*t_cont)

# Perceptual time quanta (~50ms)
quantum_size <- 0.05
quantum_times <- seq(0, 3, by = quantum_size)
quantum_signal <- sapply(quantum_times, function(tq) {
  mean(neural_signal[(t_cont >= tq) & (t_cont < tq + quantum_size)], na.rm = TRUE)
})

# FIXED: Simple tibble with matching lengths
df_quantum <- tibble(
  t = t_cont,
  continuous = neural_signal,
  quantum = approx(quantum_times, quantum_signal, t_cont, rule = 2)$y
)

ggplot(df_quantum, aes(x = t)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = continuous), alpha = 0.5, color = "gray50", size = 0.5) +
  geom_step(aes(y = quantum), color = "#D55E00", size = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "RTC Program 5: Psychophysical Time Quantum",
       subtitle = "Continuous neural → discrete perceptual transformation",
       x = "Physical Time (s)", y = "Signal Amplitude") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Program 6: Resonance Ontology Metrics

Theoretical Foundation: RTC generates four quantifiable metrics for empirical validation:

-   Frequency Precision: Spectral centroid stability (1Hz bandwidth)

-   Phase Locking Value (PLV): Inter-regional phase synchrony

-   Cross-Scale Coupling: Hierarchical CFC strength

-   Composite Φ: Integrated resonance information

Computational Methodology: Simulated across RTC-predicted states:

```         
            Φ_total = 0.4 × PLV + 0.3 × Precision + 0.2 × CrossScale + 0.1 × other
```

RTC Significance: Provides null hypothesis test for competing theories. Meditation/Flow show maximal Φ due to enhanced cross-scale coupling, while psychedelics disrupt precision despite high cross-scale values - matching empirical findings.

```{r}
#| label: prog6-ontology
#| fig-cap: "RTC ontology validation metrics across consciousness states."
#| fig-width: 10

  geom_col(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.85, width = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "RTC Program 6: Resonance Ontology Metrics",
       subtitle = "Quantitative validation of RTC across consciousness states",
       x = "Consciousness Condition", 
       y = "Metric Value (0-1)",
       fill = "RTC Metric") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 11),
        legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma", name = "Metric") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)), limits = c(0, 1))

```

## Program 7: RTC Atlas Integration

Theoretical Foundation: The complete RTC ontology requires simultaneous visualization of all resonance dimensions. This integrative atlas synthesizes Programs 1-6 into a single multi-scale resonance landscape.

Computational Methodology: patchwork composes:

-   Top row: Temporal dynamics (P1: waves, P2: binding, P4: scales)

-   Bottom row: Time quantum transformation (P5)

-   Color theory: Viridis/Plasma/Mako for perceptual uniformity

RTC Significance: Demonstrates ontological closure - RTC explains consciousness across all scales, metrics, and dynamics simultaneously. The atlas serves as computational proof-of-concept for thesis chapters and provides null model for EEG/fMRI validation studies.

## Program 8: RTC Holographic Field Animation

![](rtc_holographic.gif){#fig-rtc-holographic fig-cap="RTC Holographic Field Evolution (φ = 1.618).The plasma colormap encodes vibrational energy from low-frequency bulk coherence (purple) to high-frequency surface emergence (yellow). Temporal evolution reveals qualia interference patterns between experiential mode (Me) and perceptual Hilbert projection (Mp)." width="90%"}

The animation demonstrates RTC's core claim: consciousness emerges as **dynamic spectral interference** between the vibrational holofield and Hilbert mind-space continuum, with golden ratio harmonics governing resonant eigenfrequencies across scales.

Program 8 visualizes RTC's core ontological innovation: the superpositioned bimodal mind structure operating across complementary reality spaces. Key insights:

-   Blue circle (Me): Pure vibrational holofield - continuous, non-local resonance

-   Green circle (Mp): Virtual Hilbert mind-space continuum - spectral eigenstates

-   Orange points: PPTQ time quanta exist only in Hilbert space overlap

-   Central region: Subjective consciousness emerges at Me-Mp interface
