    "title": "The Walking Dead of Modernity: Meaning Crisis, Totalitarianism, and the Search for The Good",
    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe figure of the zombie has long occupied a central role in modern popular culture, serving as a reflection of deep societal anxieties. More than a mere horror trope, the zombie archetype embodies existential dread, consumerist alienation, and the loss of individual agency (Bishop, 2010). In the contemporary world, this symbolism becomes even more pertinent in relation to the meaning crisis (Vervaeke, Mastropietro, & Miscevic, 2017), which has rendered individuals vulnerable to ideological possession and, in extreme cases, the rise of totalitarianism (Desmet, 2022). This article explores how the zombie archetype offers a lens through which to understand the contemporary crisis of meaning and its dangerous alignment with authoritarian structures.\nThe Zombie as a Symbol of the Modern Meaning Crisis\nJohn Vervaeke has extensively analyzed the contemporary meaning crisis as a condition in which individuals feel disconnected from deep sources of existential fulfillment (Vervaeke, 2019). This crisis manifests in a pervasive sense of nihilism, ideological extremism, and increased reliance on external authorities for validation. The zombie, a creature stripped of consciousness and purpose, represents the ultimate fate of a society that has lost its capacity for autonomous meaning-making.\nJean Baudrillard’s (1981) concept of hyperreality further elucidates the zombie’s relevance. In a world dominated by simulated realities, mass media, and consumer culture, individuals become passive absorbers of pre-packaged meaning, much like the undead who mindlessly seek sustenance. Similarly, Mark Fisher (2009) describes capitalist realism as an ideological system that restricts the imagination, making alternative modes of existence seem impossible. Zombies, in this framework, are the natural byproducts of a system that erodes agency and fosters passivity.\nOswald Spengler (1918) provides a historical perspective on civilizational decline, arguing that Western culture has entered its winter phase, where cultural exhaustion and loss of existential meaning lead to mechanized, bureaucratic, and authoritarian structures. René Guénon (1927) echoes this view in The Crisis of the Modern World, diagnosing modernity as a desacralized, materialistic age that has severed itself from metaphysical wisdom, leaving individuals spiritually adrift and vulnerable to mass ideological movements.\nPlatonic and neo-Platonic philosophy provides a fundamental critique of this phenomenon, arguing that true knowledge of the Self and reality can only be attained through intellectual reflection and metaphysical contemplation. Plato, in The Republic (380 BCE), illustrates this necessity through two crucial metaphors: the Cave and the Divided Line. The Allegory of the Cave describes how individuals, trapped in a world of illusions, mistake shadows for reality, just as modern man mistakes the superficial distractions of consumerist, capitalist culture for true fulfillment. The Divided Line metaphor further emphasizes the importance of ascending from mere opinion to intellectual understanding and ultimately to the highest form of knowledge: an apprehension of The Good. In rejecting metaphysical inquiry and discarding an overarching idea of The Good, modern Western societies have become fragmented, alienated, and unable to grasp the true nature of the Self and reality.\nMohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2007) offers a literary exploration of this crisis of meaning. The novel’s protagonist, Changez, experiences deep alienation from Western society despite his initial success in the American corporate world. His disillusionment with capitalism, cultural identity, and ideological conflict mirrors the psychological conditions described by Desmet (2022) and Fisher (2009). Much like a zombie wandering without true purpose, Changez struggles to find authentic belonging, ultimately embracing a radicalized worldview in response to his existential void. Hamid’s work thus provides a contemporary fictional narrative that aligns with broader philosophical discussions on the erosion of meaning and its consequences.\nSadegh Hedayat’s The Blind Owl (1937) similarly delves into existential despair, alienation, and the psychological fragmentation of modern man. The unnamed narrator of The Blind Owl experiences extreme isolation and encounters a series of hallucinations and surreal visions, reflecting a deep crisis of meaning. Much like the zombie archetype, Hedayat’s protagonist is trapped in a cycle of torment, unable to escape the shadow of his own mind. His detachment from reality resonates with Baudrillard’s (1981) notion of hyperreality, where the line between illusion and existence blurs. Furthermore, the novel’s themes of nihilism and existential dread align with Fisher’s (2009) critique of capitalist realism, showing how modernity strips individuals of authentic experiences and leaves them grasping for meaning in a world that offers none. Hedayat’s exploration of despair and the loss of self directly ties into the themes of ideological submission and susceptibility to authoritarianism discussed in this article.\nTotalitarianism and the Zombie Masses\nThe loss of meaning creates fertile ground for totalitarianism, a process Hannah Arendt (1951) describes as the systematic destruction of individuality in favor of mass conformity. When individuals lack intrinsic sources of purpose, they become susceptible to collective ideological movements that promise certainty, order, and belonging. Giorgio Agamben (2005) expands on this, arguing that in states of crisis, governments often invoke emergency measures that erode rights under the guise of protection, reducing individuals to mere biological existence—what he terms “bare life.”\nMattias Desmet (2022) further develops this perspective, describing how mass formation psychosis enables totalitarian structures by creating conditions where people willingly surrender their autonomy to ideological narratives. Just as zombies follow the herd instinctively, masses under totalitarian rule behave in predictable, dehumanized ways, unable to challenge the system that dictates their existence. Orwell’s 1984 (1949) presents a similar image of a populace stripped of its critical faculties, driven by fear, surveillance, and propaganda.\nConclusion: Resisting the Zombie Condition\nIf the zombie represents the endpoint of meaninglessness and authoritarian control, the antidote must lie in reclaiming individual agency and deep existential engagement. Vervaeke (2019) advocates for a return to wisdom traditions, cognitive science, and participatory meaning-making as a means of breaking free from nihilistic drift. Fisher (2009) suggests that imagining alternative social structures is the first step toward resisting ideological capture. Plato’s philosophy reminds us that only through intellectual reflection and the pursuit of The Good can we achieve a unified sense of Self and reality, forming the foundation for a healthy, harmonized society."

    "text": "The Noble Lie\nPlato introduces the concept of the noble lie—a myth or falsehood created by the rulers of the ideal city to maintain social harmony and inspire citizens to fulfill their roles. The noble lie asserts that all individuals are born with a certain nature and, therefore, belong to specific classes within society—rulers, warriors, and producers. This myth, though not literally true, is designed to instill a sense of purpose and unity, leading to a well-ordered society (Plato, 1992).\nThe noble lie in The Republic serves a crucial pedagogical function. It enables rulers to justify their power, teaches citizens to accept their roles, and ultimately sustains the ideal society. For Plato, the primary goal of philosophy was not to describe the objective nature of reality, but to guide individuals toward wisdom, virtue, and an understanding of justice. In this sense, the noble lie is less about literal deception and more about shaping the soul and encouraging the pursuit of higher knowledge."

In the Seventh Letter, Plato hints that his deepest teachings were never committed to writing, suggesting that the Forms might not have been his actual metaphysical belief, but instead a tool designed to help his students transcend the material world and elevate their minds (Plato, 2000).\nThe World of Forms presents a dualistic vision of reality, where the material world is viewed as an imperfect reflection of a higher, ideal realm. However, instead of treating the Forms as a concrete metaphysical system, one could interpret them as a “pharmakon,” a remedy or cure that leads the soul away from the distractions and imperfections of the physical world. In this interpretation, the Forms are not meant to describe an objective reality; they are instead a construct designed to encourage philosophical reflection and transcendence (Jorjani, 2019)."

In The Republic, Plato suggests that philosophers should rule the city because they alone understand the true nature of reality—the Forms. However, as the Seventh Letter suggests, Plato might not have fully believed in the literal existence of the Forms. Instead, he might have viewed the Forms as an educational tool to train future rulers and philosophers, teaching them to govern wisely and justly (Plato, 1992).\nThe Forms, in this sense, are a social construct—a way to help citizens and rulers alike understand the deeper, unchanging principles of justice, virtue, and the good. By accepting the noble lie, the ideal city would be able to maintain harmony, wisdom, and justice, leading individuals toward an enlightened, ordered existence. In this way, the Forms are not only a metaphysical concept but also an ethical and political tool designed to create a just society (Kahn, 1996)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Source: Image made by Edward F. Hillenaar with https://www.canva.com/ai-image-generator/\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nHuman understanding has been a central theme in philosophy for centuries, with various thinkers offering distinct perspectives on how we acquire knowledge, process information, and perceive reality. Five of the most influential philosophers in this domain—René Descartes, John Locke, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant—each contributed significantly to our comprehension of human cognition and epistemology. While Locke and Hume championed empiricism, Descartes and Leibniz leaned towards rationalism, and Kant sought to reconcile these opposing schools of thought. Their ideas continue to shape philosophical discourse on knowledge and understanding.\nRené Descartes and Rationalist Foundations of Knowledge\nRené Descartes (1596–1650) was a pioneering rationalist who emphasized reason as the primary source of knowledge. In Meditations on First Philosophy (Descartes 1641), Descartes sought to establish knowledge on an indubitable foundation, famously proclaiming, “Cogito, ergo sum” (“I think, therefore I am”). He argued that reason, rather than sensory experience, is the primary source of knowledge and that certain innate ideas (such as the concept of God and mathematical truths) exist independently of experience. Descartes’ dualistic view of mind and body further influenced later discussions on human cognition and the nature of consciousness.\nJohn Locke and the Theory of Empiricism\nJohn Locke (1632–1704) was a pioneering empiricist who argued that human understanding arises from sensory experience. In his seminal work, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Locke 1690), Locke rejected the notion of innate ideas, asserting instead that the mind at birth is a “tabula rasa” (blank slate). According to Locke, all knowledge derives from experience, which he categorized into two forms: sensation (external experiences from the senses) and reflection (internal mental processes). He introduced the distinction between simple and complex ideas, demonstrating how the mind constructs understanding by combining elementary perceptions. Locke’s empiricism laid the foundation for later thinkers, particularly David Hume, and remains a cornerstone of modern epistemology.\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and the Rationalist Expansion\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) further developed rationalist epistemology, proposing that knowledge is derived from innate principles rather than experience. He introduced the idea of “monads,” indivisible and self-contained entities that make up reality, and argued that human understanding results from the unfolding of these preexisting concepts. In New Essays on Human Understanding (Leibniz 1704), Leibniz directly critiqued Locke’s empiricism, contending that the mind contains innate structures that shape experience. His work anticipated later discussions on the nature of perception and cognitive structures.\nDavid Hume and Skepticism about Human Understanding\nDavid Hume (1711–1776), another leading empiricist, built upon Locke’s ideas while adopting a more skeptical approach. In A Treatise of Human Nature (Hume 1739), Hume argued that human knowledge is entirely dependent on experience and that our understanding is shaped by habit and custom rather than logical certainty. He famously questioned the principle of causation, asserting that our belief in cause and effect is based on repeated observation rather than any inherent logical necessity. Hume’s skepticism about the limits of human understanding significantly influenced later philosophical movements, including Kant’s critical philosophy.\nImmanuel Kant and the Synthesis of Rationalism and Empiricism\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) sought to bridge the gap between rationalism and empiricism with his revolutionary Critique of Pure Reason (Kant 1781). He argued that while all knowledge begins with experience, our understanding is shaped by innate cognitive structures, which he termed “categories of understanding.” These categories, such as causality and substance, organize sensory input into coherent knowledge. Kant’s “transcendental idealism” proposed that we can never know reality as it is in itself (the “noumenal world”), but only as it appears to us through our cognitive framework (the “phenomenal world”). His synthesis of rationalist and empiricist elements remains one of the most influential contributions to modern epistemology.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe philosophical contributions of Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant have profoundly shaped our understanding of human cognition. Descartes and Leibniz emphasized the primacy of reason, while Locke and Hume championed experience as the basis of knowledge. Kant, recognizing the merits of both approaches, offered a synthesis that continues to influence contemporary philosophy. Their debates on human understanding remain relevant, shaping ongoing discussions in epistemology, psychology, and cognitive science. By engaging with their ideas, we gain deeper insight into the nature of knowledge and the processes through which we comprehend the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDescartes, René. 1641.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Resonance Theory of Consciousness (RTC) proposes that the brain functions as a modulated reconstruction wave passing through a holographic field (Robbins 2017a, 2017b, 2017c) of actual occasions (Whitehead 1929, 1926). This model aligns with Henri Bergson’s metaphysical theory of consciousness (Bergson 1922b, 1911) and challenges traditional notions of perception and time. In this document, we develop a Set-Theory Mathematical Model for RTC and illustrate it using R-code visualizations.\n\nSet-Theory Mathematical Model\nDefinitions\n\nExperience Set (\\(E\\)): A collection of all possible integral experiences over time.\nPerception Set (\\(P\\)): The derivative of the Experience Set, capturing discrete moments of perception.\nBrain Modulation Function (\\(B\\)): A function that reconstructs integral experience as it interacts with the holographic field.\nField Function (\\(F\\)): The underlying vibrational structure of actual occasions in the holographic field.\n\n\n\nMathematical Representation\nWe define the integral experience as:\n\\[\nE(t)=B(t)×F(t)\n\\]\nwhere ;\n\\(E(t)\\) is the experience at time \\(t\\), \\(B(t)\\) represents brain modulation, and \\(F(t)\\) represents the field vibrations.\nThe perception function is then given by the derivative:\n\\[\nP(t) = \\frac{dE}{dt}\n\\]\nSince RCT posits that perception and time are identical sets, the traditional notion of time as an independent variable is redundant. Instead, perception itself serves as the basis for structuring experiences.\n\n\nExperience as Integral\nIn the RCT model, the pure experience \\(E(t)\\) is the result of the interaction between the brain’s modulation wave \\(B(t)\\) and the holographic field of actual occasions \\(F(t)\\). So, the experience is the integral of these interactions, forming the foundational, undifferentiated state of consciousness. This can be mathematically expressed as:\n\\[\nE(t) = B(t) \\times F(t)\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\(E(t)\\) represents the pure experience at time \\(t\\), which is the integral experience. \\(B(t)\\) represents the brain’s modulated wave at time \\(t\\), capturing the dynamism of brain activity over time. \\(F(t)\\) represents the holographic field of actual occasions at time \\(t\\), capturing the vibrational modes and actual occasions underlying reality. In RTC, experience \\(E(t)\\) is not perception yet. It is a fundamental, pre-perceptual experience from which perceptions will later emerge as derivatives.\n\n\nDerivative Perceptions as Functions of Experience\nOnce experience \\(E(t)\\) is formed through the interaction of the brain’s wave and the holographic field, perception \\(P(t)\\) can be considered a derivative of the total experience. This is akin to how a derivative represents the rate of change of an integral. Thus, perception is a function that emerges from the underlying experience and is dependent on the frequency and modulation of the brain’s wave. We can model perception \\(P(t)\\) as:\n\\[\nP(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}E(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(B(t) \\times F(t))\n\\]\nHere, \\(P(t)\\) represents the derivative perception at time \\(t\\), which arises from the change in experience over time. This means that perception emerges from the underlying dynamic experience that results from the modulation of brain waves through the holographic field.\n\n\nPerception as a Time-Dependent Function of Experience\nThe perception set \\(P\\) evolves over time as a function of the modulation of brain waves and the vibrational field. Since the brain’s interaction with the holographic field is time-dependent, the perception at any given moment is determined by how the brain’s wave modulates through the vibrational patterns of the holographic field. Thus, we can express this dynamic relation as:\n\\[\nP(t) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}(B(t) \\times F(t))\\right)\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\(B(t)\\) represents the wave function of the brain at time \\(t\\). \\(F(t)\\) represents the vibrational field of actual occasions at time \\(t\\). The derivative operation indicates how the perception \\(P(t)\\) evolves from the integral experience.\n\n\nTime-Dependent Modulation and Frequency\nAccording to the RTC model, the perception of matter and form is a function of the frequency of the brain’s modulated wave. The perception is not static but is instead time-dependent, changing as the brain modulates through the holographic field at different frequencies. To express this, we introduce a frequency modulation function \\(f_{mod}(t)\\), which modulates the experience \\(E(t)\\) as it evolves over time. This means that the brain’s interaction with the holographic field is affected by how the brain changes its frequency modulation. Thus, the corrected relationship for perception over time becomes:\n\\[\nP(t) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}(E(t) \\times f_{mod}(t))\\right)\n\\]\nwhere:\n• \\(E(t)\\) is the integral experience as defined earlier, \\(f_{mod}(t)\\) is the frequency modulation function, which determines how the brain’s wave frequency changes over time. This dynamic relationship explains how perception is a time-dependent derivative of the underlying, integrated experience.\n\n\nSummary of the Set-Theory Model of RTC\n\nExperience \\(E(t)\\) as the Integral: The pure experience \\(E(t)\\) arises from the interaction of the brain’s wave \\(B(t)\\) and the holographic field \\(F(t)\\), representing the integral experience.\n\n\\[\nE(t) = B(t) \\times F(t)\n\\]\nwhere \\(E(t)\\) is the undifferentiated experience that is the base of perception.\n\nPerception \\(P(t)\\) as the Derivative of Experience: The perception \\(P(t)\\) arises as the derivative of the integral experience, which reflects the dynamic change of experience over time.\n\n\\[\nP(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(B(t) \\times F(t))\n\\]\nPerception emerges as a result of the brain’s modulation and its interaction with the holographic field.\n\nFrequency Modulation and Time-Dependent Perception: The modulation of the brain’s wave through the holographic field is affected by the frequency \\(f_{mod}(t)\\), which determines how form and matter are perceived at different frequencies.\n\n\\[\nP(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(E(t) \\times f_{mod}(t))\n\\]\nThis model reflects that experience is the foundational integral, and perception is the derivative of this experience over time. This aligns with the theory that perception is a time-dependent derivative of an underlying integral experience, solving the Hard Problem of Consciousness by explaining how qualia and perceptions emerge dynamically from this foundational interaction.\n\n\nPerception is Time in the Resonance Theory of Consciousness\nTo address the question of whether there is a difference between the Perception set \\(P(t)\\) and time \\(t\\), I need to show that both concepts are not distinct entities in the Resonance Theory of Consciousness (RTC) and that introducing a separate “time” set in addition to the perception set is unnecessary and redundant.\nKey Argument:\nIn the RTC model, perception is a time-dependent process, and the experience of time itself is inherently tied to perception. The perception set, \\(P(t)\\), evolves over time, and time is represented as a dynamic unfolding within the set of perceptions. Since perception is inseparable from the passage of time (being a function of the brain’s wave passing through the holographic field), time and perception are not separate dimensions but are intrinsically coupled."

A range of temperatures (0-40°C) was simulated. Perceived time was modeled as inversely proportional to the normalized metabolic rate.\nIn this model:\n\nAs temperature increases, metabolic rate increases (following the Arrhenius equation).\nPerceived time is modeled as inversely proportional to metabolic rate (faster metabolism = slower perceived time passage).\n\nThe resulting plot will show how metabolic rate increases with temperature, while perceived time for a fixed actual time decreases. This illustrates the concept that higher temperatures could lead to faster metabolic processes, potentially making time seem to pass more slowly.\nNote that this is a simplified model and real biological systems are much more complex. The actual relationship between temperature, metabolic rate, and time perception in humans is not fully understood and would involve many more factors.\n\n\nAmphetamine Experiment Simulation:\nA simulated experiment was conducted with two conditions: Placebo and Amphetamine. Sixty simulated subjects were divided equally between the two conditions. Participants “estimated” time intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 seconds, with five trials per interval. Amphetamine was modeled as increasing perceived duration (drug_effect = 1.2), and a small increase in variability was included (noise_level = 0.6).\nThis simulation provides a framework for understanding how amphetamines might affect time perception, but it’s important to note that real-world effects can be more complex and vary based on dosage, individual differences, and specific experimental conditions.\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Function to simulate time perception\nsimulate_time_perception &lt;- function(actual_time, drug_effect, noise) {\n  perceived_time &lt;- actual_time * drug_effect + rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = noise)\n  return(max(perceived_time, 0))  # Ensure non-negative time\n}\n\n# Experiment parameters\nn_subjects &lt;- 60  # Total number of subjects\nactual_times &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)  # Actual time intervals to estimate in seconds\ntrials_per_time &lt;- 5  # Number of trials for each time interval\n\n# Drug conditions\nconditions &lt;- c(\"Placebo\", \"Amphetamine\")\ndrug_effects &lt;- c(1, 1.2)  # Amphetamine increases perceived duration\nnoise_levels &lt;- c(0.5, 0.6)  # Slightly increased variability with amphetamine\n\n# Simulate experiment\nsimulate_condition &lt;- function(n, effect, noise) {\n  results &lt;- data.frame()\n  for (subject in 1:n) {\n    for (time in actual_times) {\n      for (trial in 1:trials_per_time) {\n        perceived &lt;- simulate_time_perception(time, effect, noise)\n        results &lt;- rbind(results, data.frame(Subject = subject, \n                                             ActualTime = time, \n                                             PerceivedTime = perceived))\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return(results)\n}\n\nall_data &lt;- data.frame()\nfor (i in 1:length(conditions)) {\n  condition_data &lt;- simulate_condition(n_subjects/2, drug_effects[i], noise_levels[i])\n  condition_data$Condition &lt;- conditions[i]\n  all_data &lt;- rbind(all_data, condition_data)\n}\n\n# # Calculate mean perceived time for each actual time and condition\n# summary_data &lt;- aggregate(PerceivedTime ~ ActualTime + Condition, data = all_data, FUN = mean)\n# \n# # Perform statistical analysis\n# model &lt;- lm(PerceivedTime ~ ActualTime * Condition, data = all_data)\n# summary(model)\n\n\n\n\nLSD Experiment Simulation:\nA simulated experiment was conducted with four conditions: Placebo, LSD 5ug, LSD 10ug, and LSD 20ug.

    "text": "Source: Image created by Edward F. Hillenaar with https://www.canva.com/ai-image-generator/\n\n\n\nAbstract\nBlindsight, a phenomenon in which patients with visual cortex damage exhibit residual visual abilities despite being subjectively blind, poses a challenge to traditional models of perception and consciousness. The Resonance Theory of Consciousness (RTC) provides a novel framework for understanding blindsight by positing that perception is the derivative of experience. This theory suggests that the brain fragments the continuous vibrational flow of reality into discrete perceptual units, influenced by the psychological unit of duration (50–100 msec). In the case of blindsight, RTC suggests that residual vision emerges from intact vibrational resonance pathways that bypass the primary visual cortex. This paper explores how RTC explains the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying blindsight and provides insights into its implications for consciousness research.\n\n\nIntroduction\nBlindsight challenges conventional theories of vision and consciousness by demonstrating that visual information can be processed and acted upon without conscious awareness. Classical models of vision suggest that damage to the striate cortex (V1) results in a complete loss of visual perception. However, blindsight patients can detect and respond to visual stimuli in their blind fields, despite lacking subjective awareness of seeing.\n\n\nCode\nknitr::include_graphics(\"striateV1.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image of the striate cortex (V1) where damage usually results in a complete loss of visual perception.\n\n\n\n\n\nRTC proposes that perception is the derivative of experience, meaning that the brain actively transforms continuous sensory input into discrete perceptual units for cognitive processing. This transformation occurs within the psychological unit of duration (50–100 msec), allowing the brain to generate approximately ten perceptual objects per second. In blindsight, RTC suggests that while the primary perceptual pathway is disrupted, residual vibrational resonance mechanisms in the brain allow for the extraction of limited visual information, albeit below the threshold of conscious perception.\n\n\nRTC and the Mechanisms of Blindsight\nVibrational Resonance and Perception\nRTC posits that reality consists of an undivided vibrational flow, which the brain discretizes into manageable perceptual fragments. In normal vision, this process occurs via the striate cortex, which segments visual input into distinct perceptual objects. However, in blindsight, alternative resonance pathways outside the striate cortex—such as those involving the superior colliculus, pulvinar, and extrastriate areas—allow for residual visual processing.\nPsychological Unit of Duration and Residual Vision\nBlindsight patients often exhibit responses to motion-based stimuli rather than stationary objects (Bao et al. 2024). According to RTC, motion perception is particularly reliant on rhythmic resonance patterns that align with the psychological unit of duration (Poppel 1978). Since motion involves continuous change over time, its resonance may persist even when standard object perception fails. This explains why blindsight patients report awareness of moving but not static stimuli, as seen in functional MRI studies.\nNeuroplasticity and Cortical Reorganization\nRecent neuroimaging studies indicate that in blindsight patients, visual processing shifts to the ipsilateral hemisphere (Bao et al. 2024), suggesting compensatory neuroplasticity. RTC interprets this phenomenon as evidence of an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory resonance interactions across cortical networks. Damage to V1 disrupts standard perceptual segmentation, but the underlying vibrational framework remains intact, allowing perception to manifest in non-traditional neural pathways.\n\n\nTheoretical Implications of RTC for Consciousness and Blindsight\nBlindsight offers profound insights into the nature of consciousness. Traditional models argue that conscious awareness arises from neural activation in specific cortical regions. However, RTC suggests that consciousness is a function of resonance alignment between neural activity and the vibrational structure of reality. In blindsight, perception occurs without subjective awareness because the derivative function of perception is only partially reconstructed from residual vibrational input.\nThis aligns with cases where blindsight patients exhibit size constancy and object completion, despite lacking conscious recognition. RTC posits that while full conscious perception requires an intact derivative transformation process, residual resonance allows for partial per-ception without subjective experience.\n\n\nConclusion\nRTC and Future Research on Blindsight The Resonance Theory of Consciousness provides a novel explanation for blindsight by suggesting that residual vision arises from alternative vibrational resonance pathways rather than conventional visual processing circuits. This theory challenges traditional models by framing perception as the derivative of an undivided vibrational reality.\nFuture research should investigate how vibrational resonance mechanisms influence cortical plasticity and alternative neural pathways in blindsight patients. Understanding these processes could lead to new therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing residual vision in indi-viduals with cortical blindness.\nBy integrating RTC into the study of blindsight, we gain deeper insight into the fundamental nature of perception, consciousness, and neuroplasticity, reinforcing the idea that conscious awareness emerges not simply from neural activity but from its alignment with the vibrational fabric of reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAbe, Saburo. 1935. “Experimental Study on the Co-Relation Between Time and Space.” PhD thesis, Tohoku University.\n\n\nAllan, Lorraine G. 1979. “The Perception of Time.” Perception & Psychophysics 26 (5): 340–54.\n\n\nAllman, Melissa J, Sundeep Teki, Timothy D Griffiths, and Warren H Meck. 2014. “Properties of the Internal Clock: First-and Second-Order Principles of Subjective Time.” Annual Review of Psychology 65 (1): 743–71.\n\n\nBao, Yan, Bin Zhou, Xinchi Yu, Lihua Mao, Evgeny Gutyrchik, Marco Paolini, Nikos Logothetis, and Ernst Pöppel. 2024. “Conscious vision in blindness: A new perceptual phenomenon implemented on the ‘wrong’ side of the brain.” PsyCh Journal, no.

Instead, all structuring, creation, and vision of reality are attributed exclusively to Brahman, reducing human agency to mere acceptance of predetermined fate.\nThis metaphysical stance contradicts the Promethean ideal of self-determination and creative agency, as articulated in my broader philosophical work. A proper understanding of consciousness must recognize the necessity of mediation—where the mind serves as a bridge between external reality and ultimate comprehension—rather than positioning it as an inert receptacle of cosmic determinism."

    "text": "Bernardo Kastrup’s Analytic Idealism and Its Parallels to the Bhagavad Gita’s Metaphysics\nA striking modern parallel to the flawed metaphysical framework of the Bhagavad Gita is found in Bernardo Kastrup’s analytical idealism. Kastrup frequently argues that all of reality is fundamentally mental, but his interpretation results in a metaphysical outlook that, like the Bhagavad Gita, denies human free will, self-determination, and agency. His version of idealism ultimately renders the human mind a mere expression of a universal mind, stripping it of its role as an active mediator in shaping reality.\nKastrup’s position, widely discussed in his numerous internet appearances and YouTube dialogues with other thinkers in the philosophy of mind, consistently reinforces this deterministic view of consciousness. Despite presenting his theory as a sophisticated and rigorous form of idealism, his framework repeats the same fundamental error as the Bhagavad Gita: it misplaces the subjective human mind in the ontological hierarchy, reducing it to a passive reflection of an all-encompassing mental field. As a result, just as the Bhagavad Gita subordinates Arjuna’s will to the divine will of Brahman, Kastrup’s metaphysics subordinates individual consciousness to an overarching cosmic mind, denying the possibility of genuine autonomy and creative agency."

Recognizing the mind’s rightful position as an active mediator reinstates the hierarchical structure necessary for genuine knowledge and self-determined action. In this revised framework, consciousness is neither a passive recipient nor an omnipotent creator but an essential intermediary that both interprets and shapes reality.\nBy acknowledging this structural necessity, we move beyond the deterministic worldviews of both the Bhagavad Gita and Kastrup’s analytical idealism, and towards a model of consciousness that affirms free will, creativity, and self-determination. This shift is crucial for a metaphysics that genuinely supports human autonomy and the evolution of knowledge."

His story embodies the human struggle for freedom, knowledge, and creative transformation—all of which are essential in breaking free from the constraints of Misplaced Abstractness.\n\n1. Prometheus and the Rebirth of Free Will\nPrometheus’ defiance against divine authority mirrors the need to reject deterministic abstractions that rob individuals of agency. Just as he stole fire to illuminate the darkness, individuals must reclaim their innate freedom by transcending the restrictive metaphysical assumptions of materialism, dualism, and idealism. Free will, rather than being an illusion (Dennett, 2003), is an active force of creative engagement with reality.\nJason Reza Jorjani (2016, 2019) has extensively analyzed the Prometheus archetype as a symbol of human spiritual and intellectual evolution. In Prometheus and Atlas, he argues that Prometheus represents the force of creative rebellion and the rejection of imposed dogmas, particularly within scientific and philosophical paradigms. In Prometheism, he extends this idea by advocating for a radical re-enchantment of reality, where human beings actively shape their destiny rather than passively accepting deterministic models (Jorjani, 2019).\n\n\n2. Creativity as a Path to Healing\nPrometheus represents not only rebellion but also the transformative power of creation. Fire symbolizes knowledge, artistic expression, and the ability to forge new paths. In modern society, reclaiming creativity—whether through art, philosophy, or scientific inquiry—serves as an antidote to existential alienation. Creativity allows individuals to engage dynamically with existence, rather than passively conforming to rigid conceptual structures.\nJorjani (2023) further elaborates on this idea in his discussions on the sociological impact of the Prometheus archetype. In his lecture (Jorjani, 2023), he emphasizes that Promethean creativity is essential for overcoming technocratic alienation, which reduces individuals to mere components of an automated system, stripping them of their imaginative and spiritual potential.\n\n\n3. Reconnecting Spirit and Soul with Reality\nPrometheus challenges hierarchical structures that impose false ontologies. His myth suggests that true resonance with reality is not found in adaptation to societal speed but in an active re-engagement with the vibrational nature of being. This involves embracing the paradoxes of existence—both structure and fluidity, both agency and interconnectedness—rather than succumbing to static abstractions."

While acceleration is a significant factor, Rosa’s framework fails to address the deeper ontological error underlying alienation.\nMisplaced Abstractness, rather than acceleration alone, is the true source of mental suffering. Acceleration is merely an external manifestation of a deeper cognitive and spiritual disconnection. Rosa’s emphasis on slowing down and fostering resonance with the world is valuable, yet it does not challenge the metaphysical assumptions that create alienation in the first place.\nA Promethean approach would go beyond resonance to advocate for an active reclaiming of agency. Rather than simply adapting to societal conditions, individuals must transform their ontological perspective—moving beyond static abstractions and engaging with reality as an ever-evolving, participatory process."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nHeraclitus, the pre-Socratic philosopher, described fire as the fundamental substance of the cosmos, a metaphor for the ever-changing and dynamic nature of reality. His concept of fire is not merely physical combustion but represents the ceaseless flux of existence, integrally connected to psyche (soul or consciousness) and logos (order or reason). This notion bears striking similarities to modern quantum physics, particularly the relationship between consciousness and quantum potential as understood by Werner Heisenberg. However, the influence of Heraclitus’ philosophy extends further into the core of Plato’s project, where the doctrine of eternal forms serves as a bridge to render the ever-changing nature of reality intelligible. According to Jorjani (2023), the real hidden philosophy of Plato was actually Heraclitean in nature, with the theory of forms functioning as a conceptual tool to establish knowledge and rational discourse about the observed world. By exploring Heraclitus’ view on fire, psyche, and logos in relation to Plato’s doctrine of forms, we can examine its profound philosophical implications and its connections to quantum theory.\nFire as a Metaphor for Logos and the Order of the Cosmos in Plato’s Project\nHeraclitus posited that everything is in a state of flux and that change is the only constant. He asserted that this dynamic nature of reality is governed by logos, an intrinsic order that underlies all transformations (Jorjani, 2023). The metaphor of fire encapsulates this perpetual motion, as fire constantly consumes and transforms matter, illustrating the ever-changing yet ordered nature of existence. Unlike a static entity, fire represents a self-regulating process that mirrors the cosmic order.\nPlato, often seen as an opponent of Heraclitean thought, actually embedded Heraclitus’ insights at the core of his own philosophical system. The doctrine of eternal forms, rather than being a rejection of flux, was Plato’s way of providing a rational framework for understanding the mutable world. Plato’s theory of forms, as described in the Timaeus, suggests that the interaction between immutable mathematical forms and the flux of matter generates the physical world. This notion resonates with Heraclitus’ concept of fire, wherein change is structured and not chaotic. The mathematical structure of reality, as suggested by Pythagoras and Plato, complements Heraclitus’ view that fire (flux) is governed by a deeper order, which we can comprehend through rational inquiry.\nFire, Psyche, and Consciousness: Plato’s Rational Mediation of Flux\nHeraclitus emphasized the interconnection between fire and psyche, suggesting that consciousness is intimately tied to the ever-changing nature of reality. He argued that psyche is not separate from the cosmic flux but is embedded within it (Jorjani, 2023). This perspective prefigures the idea in quantum mechanics that consciousness plays a role in shaping reality, particularly in the collapse of the quantum wave function.\nPlato, rather than discarding this view, adapted it through his doctrine of forms. While material reality is always in flux, the forms provide a stabilizing principle that allows the mind to make sense of the world. In this way, Plato’s project can be seen as an attempt to harmonize the Heraclitean view of reality with the need for knowledge and intelligibility. According to Jorjani (2023), Plato’s real philosophical allegiance was to Heraclitus, and the doctrine of forms was not an outright rejection of flux but a necessary tool to bridge the gap between the rational mind and the mutable world.\nWerner Heisenberg, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, saw a parallel between Heraclitus’ vision of reality and the quantum world. The notion that reality exists in a state of potentiality until observed aligns with Heraclitus’ idea that existence is a continuous process rather than a static entity. In quantum mechanics, particles exist in a superposition of states until measured, akin to Heraclitus’ fire, which embodies the perpetual transformation of all things (Heisenberg, 1958). Plato’s mediation of this flux through the theory of forms is reminiscent of how scientific models allow us to make sense of an otherwise indeterminate quantum world.\nHeraclitus as a Precursor to Quantum Potential and Plato’s Hidden Philosophy\nHeraclitus’ understanding of fire as a dynamic, interconnected process can be seen as an early conceptualization of quantum potential. In quantum physics, potentiality is not an abstract metaphysical notion but a measurable aspect of reality that dictates probabilities of particle behavior. Similarly, Heraclitus described fire as an ever-present force that drives transformation while maintaining an inherent order (Jorjani, 2023).\nPlato’s doctrine of forms, when reinterpreted in this Heraclitean light, serves a function similar to quantum wave equations in physics. While reality itself is dynamic and indeterminate, the forms provide the rational structure through which we can understand and interact with the world. The collapse of the quantum wave function due to conscious observation suggests that reality is not independent of the observer, much like Heraclitus’ assertion that psyche is intertwined with the cosmic flux. This connection between mind and matter challenges classical mechanistic views and supports an interpretation of reality where consciousness and physical processes are fundamentally linked (Heisenberg, 1958). Plato’s true philosophical achievement, as Jorjani (2023) suggests, was in crafting a system that acknowledged the flux of Heraclitus while providing a rational means to engage with it.\n\n\nConclusion\nHeraclitus’ philosophy of fire, psyche, and logos provides a profound precursor to modern quantum physics, particularly in the way it anticipates the relationship between consciousness and reality. His view that the universe is in constant flux yet structured by an inherent order aligns with Heisenberg’s interpretation of quantum mechanics. More importantly, Plato’s philosophical project, when properly understood, was not an opposition to Heraclitus but rather a sophisticated attempt to systematize his insights. Fire, as Heraclitus describes it, is more than a physical element; it is a symbol of the fundamental processes that govern existence, paralleling the quantum potential that underlies material reality. By revisiting Heraclitus’ insights through the lens of Plato’s project, we gain a deeper appreciation of how ancient philosophical perspectives continue to inform contemporary scientific thought.\n\n\nReferences\nHeisenberg, W.

Nash 1951). This process suggests that Nash’s hallucinations were not flaws but extensions of his cognitive abilities—his way of engaging with a reality richer than the conventional sensory world."

    "text": "Creativity, Intellect, and the Formation of Experience\nNash’s ability to visualize abstract mathematical relationships (J. Nash 1953) suggests that his mind operated in an enhanced state of pattern recognition. If perception is fundamentally a resonance-based activity, then his hallucinations might have been the unintended byproduct of his heightened capacity to recognize and structure patterns (Capps 2011). In this sense, his condition could be reinterpreted as an evolutionary advancement of the mind, wherein his intellect spontaneously generated stable projections from the vibrational holographic field. Rather than seeing Nash’s experiences as symptoms of an illness, we can view them as an emergent property of an extraordinarily sensitive and creative consciousness. His mind, attuned to deep structures of reality, may have acted as a bridge between the explicate and implicate dimensions—an artist of perception who, instead of painting on a canvas, structured reality itself into experiential forms."

    "text": "Implications for Consciousness and Psychiatry\nIf Nash’s hallucinations were manifestations of resonance with the holographic vibrational field, then psychiatry’s traditional approach to schizophrenia (Parker 2015) may require re-evaluation. Instead of suppressing such experiences through medication, future research could explore how individuals like Nash engage with deeper cognitive processes. Could it be possible that so-called hallucinations are windows into dimensions of reality that most minds are not conditioned to perceive? If so, individuals with such perceptual abilities might not be mentally ill but rather cognitively evolved in ways yet to be understood (Rettner 2015). Furthermore, this perspective invites new approaches in the study of consciousness, suggesting that reality is not a fixed construct but a dynamic interplay between mind and vibrational structure. Nash’s experiences serve as an intriguing case study for exploring how intellect, perception, and resonance interact to form what we call reality."
