    "title": "The Walking Dead of Modernity: Meaning Crisis, Totalitarianism, and the Search for The Good",
    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe figure of the zombie has long occupied a central role in modern popular culture, serving as a reflection of deep societal anxieties. More than a mere horror trope, the zombie archetype embodies existential dread, consumerist alienation, and the loss of individual agency (Bishop, 2010). In the contemporary world, this symbolism becomes even more pertinent in relation to the meaning crisis (Vervaeke, Mastropietro, & Miscevic, 2017), which has rendered individuals vulnerable to ideological possession and, in extreme cases, the rise of totalitarianism (Desmet, 2022). This article explores how the zombie archetype offers a lens through which to understand the contemporary crisis of meaning and its dangerous alignment with authoritarian structures.\nThe Zombie as a Symbol of the Modern Meaning Crisis\nJohn Vervaeke has extensively analyzed the contemporary meaning crisis as a condition in which individuals feel disconnected from deep sources of existential fulfillment (Vervaeke, 2019). This crisis manifests in a pervasive sense of nihilism, ideological extremism, and increased reliance on external authorities for validation. The zombie, a creature stripped of consciousness and purpose, represents the ultimate fate of a society that has lost its capacity for autonomous meaning-making.\nJean Baudrillard’s (1981) concept of hyperreality further elucidates the zombie’s relevance. In a world dominated by simulated realities, mass media, and consumer culture, individuals become passive absorbers of pre-packaged meaning, much like the undead who mindlessly seek sustenance. Similarly, Mark Fisher (2009) describes capitalist realism as an ideological system that restricts the imagination, making alternative modes of existence seem impossible. Zombies, in this framework, are the natural byproducts of a system that erodes agency and fosters passivity.\nOswald Spengler (1918) provides a historical perspective on civilizational decline, arguing that Western culture has entered its winter phase, where cultural exhaustion and loss of existential meaning lead to mechanized, bureaucratic, and authoritarian structures. René Guénon (1927) echoes this view in The Crisis of the Modern World, diagnosing modernity as a desacralized, materialistic age that has severed itself from metaphysical wisdom, leaving individuals spiritually adrift and vulnerable to mass ideological movements.\nPlatonic and neo-Platonic philosophy provides a fundamental critique of this phenomenon, arguing that true knowledge of the Self and reality can only be attained through intellectual reflection and metaphysical contemplation. Plato, in The Republic (380 BCE), illustrates this necessity through two crucial metaphors: the Cave and the Divided Line. The Allegory of the Cave describes how individuals, trapped in a world of illusions, mistake shadows for reality, just as modern man mistakes the superficial distractions of consumerist, capitalist culture for true fulfillment. The Divided Line metaphor further emphasizes the importance of ascending from mere opinion to intellectual understanding and ultimately to the highest form of knowledge: an apprehension of The Good. In rejecting metaphysical inquiry and discarding an overarching idea of The Good, modern Western societies have become fragmented, alienated, and unable to grasp the true nature of the Self and reality.\nMohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2007) offers a literary exploration of this crisis of meaning. The novel’s protagonist, Changez, experiences deep alienation from Western society despite his initial success in the American corporate world. His disillusionment with capitalism, cultural identity, and ideological conflict mirrors the psychological conditions described by Desmet (2022) and Fisher (2009). Much like a zombie wandering without true purpose, Changez struggles to find authentic belonging, ultimately embracing a radicalized worldview in response to his existential void. Hamid’s work thus provides a contemporary fictional narrative that aligns with broader philosophical discussions on the erosion of meaning and its consequences.\nSadegh Hedayat’s The Blind Owl (1937) similarly delves into existential despair, alienation, and the psychological fragmentation of modern man. The unnamed narrator of The Blind Owl experiences extreme isolation and encounters a series of hallucinations and surreal visions, reflecting a deep crisis of meaning. Much like the zombie archetype, Hedayat’s protagonist is trapped in a cycle of torment, unable to escape the shadow of his own mind. His detachment from reality resonates with Baudrillard’s (1981) notion of hyperreality, where the line between illusion and existence blurs. Furthermore, the novel’s themes of nihilism and existential dread align with Fisher’s (2009) critique of capitalist realism, showing how modernity strips individuals of authentic experiences and leaves them grasping for meaning in a world that offers none. Hedayat’s exploration of despair and the loss of self directly ties into the themes of ideological submission and susceptibility to authoritarianism discussed in this article.\nTotalitarianism and the Zombie Masses\nThe loss of meaning creates fertile ground for totalitarianism, a process Hannah Arendt (1951) describes as the systematic destruction of individuality in favor of mass conformity. When individuals lack intrinsic sources of purpose, they become susceptible to collective ideological movements that promise certainty, order, and belonging. Giorgio Agamben (2005) expands on this, arguing that in states of crisis, governments often invoke emergency measures that erode rights under the guise of protection, reducing individuals to mere biological existence—what he terms “bare life.”\nMattias Desmet (2022) further develops this perspective, describing how mass formation psychosis enables totalitarian structures by creating conditions where people willingly surrender their autonomy to ideological narratives. Just as zombies follow the herd instinctively, masses under totalitarian rule behave in predictable, dehumanized ways, unable to challenge the system that dictates their existence. Orwell’s 1984 (1949) presents a similar image of a populace stripped of its critical faculties, driven by fear, surveillance, and propaganda.\nConclusion: Resisting the Zombie Condition\nIf the zombie represents the endpoint of meaninglessness and authoritarian control, the antidote must lie in reclaiming individual agency and deep existential engagement. Vervaeke (2019) advocates for a return to wisdom traditions, cognitive science, and participatory meaning-making as a means of breaking free from nihilistic drift. Fisher (2009) suggests that imagining alternative social structures is the first step toward resisting ideological capture. Plato’s philosophy reminds us that only through intellectual reflection and the pursuit of The Good can we achieve a unified sense of Self and reality, forming the foundation for a healthy, harmonized society."

    "section": "The Noble Lie",
    "text": "The Noble Lie\nPlato introduces the concept of the noble lie—a myth or falsehood created by the rulers of the ideal city to maintain social harmony and inspire citizens to fulfill their roles. The noble lie asserts that all individuals are born with a certain nature and, therefore, belong to specific classes within society—rulers, warriors, and producers. This myth, though not literally true, is designed to instill a sense of purpose and unity, leading to a well-ordered society (Plato, 1992).\nThe noble lie in The Republic serves a crucial pedagogical function. It enables rulers to justify their power, teaches citizens to accept their roles, and ultimately sustains the ideal society. For Plato, the primary goal of philosophy was not to describe the objective nature of reality, but to guide individuals toward wisdom, virtue, and an understanding of justice. In this sense, the noble lie is less about literal deception and more about shaping the soul and encouraging the pursuit of higher knowledge."

    "text": "A Pedagogical Tool\nIt is plausible to argue that his Theory of Forms—a metaphysical model in which true reality consists of unchanging, eternal abstract ideas—is similarly a pedagogical device, rather than a literal claim about the nature of the universe. In the Seventh Letter, Plato hints that his deepest teachings were never committed to writing, suggesting that the Forms might not have been his actual metaphysical belief, but instead a tool designed to help his students transcend the material world and elevate their minds (Plato, 2000).\nThe World of Forms presents a dualistic vision of reality, where the material world is viewed as an imperfect reflection of a higher, ideal realm. However, instead of treating the Forms as a concrete metaphysical system, one could interpret them as a “pharmakon,” a remedy or cure that leads the soul away from the distractions and imperfections of the physical world. In this interpretation, the Forms are not meant to describe an objective reality; they are instead a construct designed to encourage philosophical reflection and transcendence (Jorjani, 2019)."

    "section": "Plato’s secret Heraclitean Metaphysics",
    "text": "Plato’s secret Heraclitean Metaphysics\nThis approach aligns with a more Heraclitean view of reality, where the physical world is in a constant state of flux and change. Heraclitus believed that reality is in a state of perpetual becoming, and that the only constant is change itself (Heraclitus, 2001). Plato’s Theory of Forms could then be understood as a way of helping individuals see beyond the chaos and impermanence of the material world to grasp the eternal truths that lie at the heart of existence. In this sense, Plato’s metaphysics would not contradict Heraclitus’ emphasis on change but instead offer a framework for engaging with that change in a meaningful and structured way.\nPlato’s True Metaphysics: A Heraclitean Perspective If Plato’s noble lie extends to the Theory of Forms, it suggests that his true metaphysical views might have been closer to Heraclitus’ philosophy of constant flux. Plato’s commitment to the Forms may have been a rhetorical device, an illusion that allowed him to offer his students a conceptual framework that would elevate their souls and minds. In his dialogues, Plato often used Socratic irony—the art of making one’s interlocutors think they understand something when, in fact, they are only beginning to grasp it. The Forms, then, might have been Plato’s way of guiding minds toward enlightenment, while subtly avoiding a rigid metaphysical doctrine.\nThis interpretation challenges the traditional view that Plato’s philosophy was a rigid dualism between the changing material world and the unchanging world of Forms. Instead, it suggests that Plato’s ultimate goal was not to describe reality, but to shape individuals and society. The Forms acted as a noble lie, a higher narrative meant to guide people toward a state of wisdom, justice, and truth. Plato’s ultimate metaphysical commitment may have been a recognition that the world is in constant flux, but that philosophical tools like the Forms could help individuals rise above the chaos and engage with the deeper truths of existence (Fine, 1993)."

    "text": "Role of Plato’s Noble Lie\nBy placing the Forms in the context of Plato’s ideal state, we can further understand how the noble lie functions not only on an individual level, but also within society. In The Republic, Plato suggests that philosophers should rule the city because they alone understand the true nature of reality—the Forms. However, as the Seventh Letter suggests, Plato might not have fully believed in the literal existence of the Forms. Instead, he might have viewed the Forms as an educational tool to train future rulers and philosophers, teaching them to govern wisely and justly (Plato, 1992).\nThe Forms, in this sense, are a social construct—a way to help citizens and rulers alike understand the deeper, unchanging principles of justice, virtue, and the good. By accepting the noble lie, the ideal city would be able to maintain harmony, wisdom, and justice, leading individuals toward an enlightened, ordered existence. In this way, the Forms are not only a metaphysical concept but also an ethical and political tool designed to create a just society (Kahn, 1996)."

    "text": "Plato’s true Heraclitean Metaphysics\nThis approach aligns with a more Heraclitean view of reality, where the physical world is in a constant state of flux and change. Heraclitus believed that reality is in a state of perpetual becoming, and that the only constant is change itself (Heraclitus, 2001). Plato’s Theory of Forms could then be understood as a way of helping individuals see beyond the chaos and impermanence of the material world to grasp the eternal truths that lie at the heart of existence. In this sense, Plato’s metaphysics would not contradict Heraclitus’ emphasis on change but instead offer a framework for engaging with that change in a meaningful and structured way.\nIf Plato’s noble lie extends to the Theory of Forms, it suggests that his true metaphysical views might have been closer to Heraclitus’ philosophy of constant flux. Plato’s commitment to the Forms may have been a rhetorical device, an illusion that allowed him to offer his students a conceptual framework that would elevate their souls and minds. In his dialogues, Plato often used Socratic irony—the art of making one’s interlocutors think they understand something when, in fact, they are only beginning to grasp it. The Forms, then, might have been Plato’s way of guiding minds toward enlightenment, while subtly avoiding a rigid metaphysical doctrine.\nThis interpretation challenges the traditional view that Plato’s philosophy was a rigid dualism between the changing material world and the unchanging world of Forms. Instead, it suggests that Plato’s ultimate goal was not to describe reality, but to shape individuals and society. The Forms acted as a noble lie, a higher narrative meant to guide people toward a state of wisdom, justice, and truth. Plato’s ultimate metaphysical commitment may have been a recognition that the world is in constant flux, but that philosophical tools like the Forms could help individuals rise above the chaos and engage with the deeper truths of existence (Fine, 1993)."
